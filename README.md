# TLS Speckle Removal
This is the demo code for the paper [1]. 
To run the demo please run `tls-master/ main_resulter.m`
* For the shearlet toolbox, I have used implementation by LMU group [2]. 
* For SaS denoising please check Alin Achim's toolbox [3].
* Those parts that are not sharable for any reason (author permission, ....) are in protected mode.
* For the Cauchy distribution implementation [4] was used.
